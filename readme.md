# Aria!

Aria is a small proof-of-concept for a cross-platform AR app
which lets you put text on physical objects and the app
will remember the location of the text.

## Features

 - No networking! (all processing done locally [with some TODOs][1])
 - Supports all platforms! (PWA manifest)
 - Free hosting! (uses github pages to serve the PWA)
